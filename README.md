# speedybot
Faster Arduino based robot

Speedybot has two HC-SR04 ultrasonic modules positioned at 90 degrees to each other and mounted on a servo. Unlike tankbot, which is quite slow, Speedybot will be much faster moving and reactive. It's servos are positioned to help facilitate wall following behaviour.
